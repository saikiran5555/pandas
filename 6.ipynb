    "Among the options listed (Series, DataFrame, Panel), both **Series** and **DataFrame** are mutable in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Series**: A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold data of various types. Elements within a Series can be modified, added, or removed after the Series is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DataFrame**: A DataFrame is a two-dimensional tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). DataFrames are also mutable, meaning you can modify the data, add new columns, or drop columns as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the term \"mutable\" means that the structure's values can be modified after creation, while \"immutable\" means that the structure's values cannot be modified once created. However, the term \"immutable\" is not applicable to Series and DataFrames since they allow modifications to their values and structure."
